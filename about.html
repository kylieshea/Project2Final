            <h2>Kylie Beauchamp</h2>
            <p>My name is <strong>Kylie Beauchamp</strong>, and I’m an undergraduate in <strong>Information Science</strong> with a focus in <strong>Data Science</strong>, as well as a certificate in <strong>Sports Communication</strong>. In addition to being a coxswain on the rowing team, my interests span across <strong>AI</strong>, <strong>sports analytics</strong>, and reading. My long-term goal is to merge athletics with technology, particularly through <strong>3D Pose Estimation for rowing</strong>.</p>
            <p>I’m passionate about problem-solving, especially in <strong>robotics</strong>, and enjoy working hands-on with projects—from building and testing to troubleshooting and refining designs. I aim to develop technical skills in web scripting while critically engaging with current issues in technology, reflecting on where we’ve come from and understanding their impact on today’s world.</p>
